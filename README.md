# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System

## 📌 Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Future Interns Cyber Security Internship (Task 3)**.  
It allows secure file uploads and downloads with **AES-256 encryption** to ensure data privacy and protection.

## 🔍 About the Task
In this hands-on internship project, I built a simple yet secure file sharing system that allows users to **upload and download files safely**.  
The main focus was **data security**, where I implemented **AES-256 encryption** to protect files both during storage and transfer.

This project simulates real-world client scenarios where secure data sharing is critical, such as in **healthcare, legal, or corporate environments**.

## ✅ What I Did
- Developed a **Flask-based web portal** for file uploads and downloads  
- Implemented **AES-256 encryption** using **PyCryptodome** to encrypt files before saving and decrypt them on download  
- Built a simple **HTML/CSS/JS user interface** for uploading, downloading, and deleting files  
- Implemented **basic key management** (AES key stored securely)  
- Tested the system with sample text and image files to verify encryption/decryption  
- Documented the **system architecture, code, and security measures**

## 🎯 Skills I Gained
- **Web Development Fundamentals** (Flask backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend)  
- **Implementing Cryptographic Algorithms** (AES encryption & decryption)  
- **Secure File Handling & Data Protection Best Practices**  
- **Basic Cryptography Concepts** (key generation, storage, and management)  
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**  
- **Working in Kali Linux environment** for cybersecurity projects
